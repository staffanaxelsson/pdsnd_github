### Description
In this project, I explored bike share data for three major cities:                                                        

* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

Based on this data, computations were performed to analyze:
* Popular times of travel 
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info

### Files used
Files used for data computations were:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

These files were not committed to github for size reasons,
but they can be found here:

* [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
* [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
